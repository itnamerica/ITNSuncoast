    <p><strong><em>Let’s Go Places!</em></strong> provides an exciting monthly calendar of events - going to the theater, art openings movies and other cultural events; shopping for necessities and fun; eating out at local restaurants; attending community events; and going to local attractions.

And, if there is a specific place you would like to go, please let us know!</p>

    <p>Door-to-door, round-trip rides to scheduled events will cost $15 with some noted exceptions. As an added benefit, we are negotiating discounts for Let’s Go Places! participants at local businesses to get you real bargains and keep the cost of getting out affordable.</p>
