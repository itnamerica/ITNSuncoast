    <p>ITN<em>{{affiliate}}</em> provides over 1,500 rides per month in the Suncoast area. The average cost to ITN of providing each ride is $12 (in addition to the fee paid by the rider). Our newest fundraising campaign, Help On Wheels, aims to cover the cost of these rides, and will allow ITN to continue to grow and serve the community.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>With a $12 per month recurring donation, you can support one ride per month to a Suncoast area citizen living on limited income.</p>

        <p>Our goal is to collect 600 recurring donations of $12 per month each.</p>

        <p>It takes only a couple of minutes to sign up, and we will send you a Help on Wheels mug in addition to a donation receipt for tax purposes.</p>

    <p>Please consider making this small tax-free recurring donation to ITN, to keep dignified transportation available in the Suncoast area.</p>
